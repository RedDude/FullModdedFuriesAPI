**FMODF** is an open-source modding framework and API for Full Metal Furies from Cellar Door Games, it is a Port from SMAPI
that lets you play the game with mods. It's safely installed alongside the game's executable, and
doesn't change any of your game files. It serves seven main purposes:

1. **Load mods into the game.**
   _FMODF loads mods when the game is starting up so they can interact with it. (Code mods aren't
   possible without FMODF to load them.)_

2. **Provide APIs and events for mods.**
   _FMODF provides APIs and events which let mods interact with the game in ways they otherwise
   couldn't._

3. **Back up your save files.**
   _FMODF automatically creates a daily backup of your saves and keeps ten backups (via the bundled
   Save Backup mod), in case something goes wrong._
